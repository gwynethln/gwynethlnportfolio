# Gwyneth Noel - Projects

Here are some self-projects I've done using Python for exploratory purposes. This list is still updating as I take on more.

## 1. [Miami Housing Price Prediction](Miami%20Housing%20Prediction.ipynb)
I predicted Miami housing prices based on a variety of features such as land/floor area, distance to the ocean/closest body of water, and more (15 features total) using a linear regression model. 

## 2. World Happiness Report 2021 Analysis
I studied the distribution of happiness ratings (ladder score) among 149 countries surveyed by the World Happiness Report in 2021, testing the effects of different forms of estimation on ladder score (flooring for "scored at least ___" vs. rounding to the nearest integer for "scored about ____").

## 3. Perfume Analysis
Using a dataset of perfumes, I studied how to retrieve certain information from the dataset before exploring different data visualizations for the notes used by a certain brand.
